# Deliverables
# Write the following methods in the classes in the files provided. Feel free to build out any helper methods if needed.

# Remember: SQLAlchemy gives your classes access to a lot of methods already! Keep in mind what methods SQLAlchemy gives you access to on each of your classes when you're approaching the deliverables below.

# Migrations
# Before working on the rest of the deliverables, you will need to create a migration for the freebies table.

# A Freebie belongs to a Dev, and a Freebie also belongs to a Company. In your migration, create any columns your freebies table will need to establish these relationships using the right foreign keys.
# The freebies table should also have:
# An item_name column that stores a string.
# A value column that stores an integer.
# After creating the freebies table using a migration, use the seed.py file to create instances of your Freebie class so you can test your code.

# After you've set up your freebies table, work on building out the following deliverables.

# Relationship Attributes and Methods
# Use SQLAlchemy's ForeignKey, relationship(), and backref() objects to build relationships between your three models.

# Note: The plural of "freebie" is "freebies" and the singular of "freebies" is "freebie".

# Freebie
# Freebie.dev returns the Dev instance for this Freebie.
# Freebie.company returns the Company instance for this Freebie.
# Company
# Company.freebies returns a collection of all the freebies for the Company.
# Company.devs returns a collection of all the devs who collected freebies from the company.
# Dev
# Dev.freebies returns a collection of all the freebies that the Dev has collected.
# Dev.companiesreturns a collection of all the companies that the Dev has collected freebies from.
# Use python debug.py and check that these methods work before proceeding. For example, you should be able to retrieve a dev from the database by its attributes and view their companies with dev.companies (based on your seed data).

# Aggregate Methods
# Freebie
# Freebie.print_details()should return a string formatted as follows: {dev name} owns a {freebie item_name} from {company name}.
# Company
# Company.give_freebie(dev, item_name, value) takes a dev (an instance of the Dev class), an item_name (string), and a value as arguments, and creates a new Freebie instance associated with this company and the given dev.
# Class method Company.oldest_company()returns the Company instance with the earliest founding year.
# Dev
# Dev.received_one(item_name) accepts an item_name (string) and returns True if any of the freebies associated with the dev has that item_name, otherwise returns False.
# Dev.give_away(dev, freebie) accepts a Dev instance and a Freebie instance, changes the freebie's dev to be the given dev; your code should only make the change if the freebie belongs to the dev who's giving it away
